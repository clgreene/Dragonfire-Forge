  - Well, it's a sword. You'll get better as you go.
  - Just a few last things to remember...
  - Your contracts will appear in the bottom left, choose which contracts you fulfill
    each day wisely.
  - Once you choose a contract you'll have to start working on it right away.
  - So before choosing a contract make sure you know where the dark armies are positioned.
  - You can check your enchanted map in the bottom center, and it will tell you how
    close the armies are to our lands.
  - Orcs, Dark Elves, the Undead, and Arachnids. Choose Contracts that will keep
    them all at bay in the best way you can.
  - You can also visit the shop in the lower right if you need materials or want
    to purchase new weapon designs.
  - Different weapon designs will accomodate different heros classes, so pay attention
    to that.
  - Good luck, and farewell!
