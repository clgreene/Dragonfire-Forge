  - Well, it's a sword. You'll get better as you go.
  - Just a few last things to remember...
  - Your contracts will appear in the bottom left, choose which contracts you fulfill
    each day wisely.
  - Part of that includes checking the enchanted map the guild provides us.
  - The map shows you the enemy movements as they push towards the free lands.
  - Orcs, Dark Elves, the Undead, and the Arachnids.
  - Make sure you focus on those heros who will keep these enemies at bay the best.
  - As you go you'll learn things about the enemies and the heros that can also help
    inform you contract and weapon-making decisions.
  - 'Your journal will keep track of those tid-bits for you to reference as you go. '
  - Make sure you keep your weapon materials stocked, if you don't have materials,
    heros don't have weapons, and the dark forces win.
  - Well, I think that's all. Farewell, and good luck!
