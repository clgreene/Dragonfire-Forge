  - Welcome to the Dragonfire Forge!
  - You've been sent here to take over the famous Dragonfire Forge
  - The Forgers Guild must have a high opinion of you to assign you here.
  - The Dragonfire Forge is any adventurers last stop to gear up before taking on
    the evils of the Darklands.
  - The weapons that are produced here directly contribute to keeping the evil armies
    of the Darklands out of the free nations.
  - If you weapons are sub-par, our kingdom will be over-run
  - That's why it's important that we provide the best gear for our clients, and
    why we should choose those clients carefully
  - It looks like you are a little low on stock, but lets see what you can do with
    some steel.
  - Go ahead and grab some steel and throw it in the forge.
  - Whenever you're ready....
