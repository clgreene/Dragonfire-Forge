  - Welcome to the Dragonfire Forge!
  - The guild sent you to be my replacement, huh?
  - Must be some serious forging skills you've got if they think you've got what
    it takes to run this place.
  - The Dragonfire Forge is any adventurers last stop to gear up before taking on
    the evils of the Darklands.
  - Because of that, the quality of our weapons directly contributes to keeping evil
    out of our lands.
  - If our weapons are trash, or if you only cater to certain adventurers, we'll
    eventually get overrun.
  - And after us, the entire kingdom.
  - That's why it's important that we provide the best gear for our clients, and
    why we should choose those clients carefully
  - We're a little low on our stock right now, but lets see what you can do.
  - Grab some steel and throw it in the forge.
  - Once it's heating, you'll have to operate bellows from both sides to keep the
    temperature up and the heat even.
  - Whenever you're ready.
